# STGAN_Colab_Testing
This repository contains a Colab Notebook that tests STGAN for facial attribute transfer for images from CelebA Dataset from https://github.com/csmliu/STGAN. 

We are using the pre-trained model available on https://drive.google.com/file/d/1329IbLE6877DcDUut1reKxckijBJye7N/view trained by the authors of the STGAN GitHub repository for testing purposes.

For knowing about what STGAN is, please refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09709

Python environment Used:
Python 3.6 with Tensorflow (1.x), matplotlib, numpy and scipy(1.1).

Dataset: We use the CelebA dataset (https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) for testing purposes.

Steps to test STGAN implementation:
-> Open Google Colab and Upload STGAN.ipynb file.
-> This notebook will contain stepwise procedre to run STGAN implmentation
-> Run the code cells while following the instructions given in STGAN.ipynb on Google Colab to successfully run the code.
